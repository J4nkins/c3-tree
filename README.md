This project uses d3.js [https://d3js.org/] to visualize data on scientific papers in a collapsible radial tree. As frontend, svelte [https://svelte.dev/] is used. As backend, a simple node server utilizing Google Sheets API [https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest]
The visualization is based on these two d3.js examples:
- Hierarchical edge bundling [https://observablehq.com/@d3/hierarchical-edge-bundling]
- Radial tree component [https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-tree-component]
